# TitanGuessr

A Northstar mod for hosting GeoGuessr games in Titanfall 2's campaign.<br>
!!! *If you're a player downloading this, the scripts contain spoilers* !!!<br><br>


## how install
Like any other Northstar mod - just drag the TitanGuessr folder into `Titanfall2\R2Northstar\mods`.<br><br>

## how use
* Use the console variable `guessr_round` to select rounds. This convar will also automatically increment if you find a location.
* You'll be notified that you found a location if you physically are in range of it in-game.
  
This comes with a specific set of rounds (since I just made it to do a lil game with my friends), but if you were looking to host your own game you'll need to edit the list of maps/locations, distribute the altered mod to your players, and provide your own images. This kind of sucks but I might try to support it better in the future.
